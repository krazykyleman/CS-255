Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
It's a website where a user can buy driver's ed courses and take practice tests provided by the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well on the diagrams. They might not be the best, they might not even be accurate, but I've never really made them like that before and what I did do I was surprised.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably the powerpoint slides. I don't know if I went into enough detail with them.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It's important to consider the user's needs when designing systems like this becasue at the end of the day this is all for the user. We don't want the user to have a bad experience when using the website, so we make sure they enjoy our services.

I usually just tried to think about how I would want a process to be designed or how I thought they already are designed. Basically, I put myself in the shoes of an user.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The first step is to always acquire information on the system that needs to be designed. That can be features, requirements, or just text size. Planning out the approach and delegating tasks to groups of people is the best strategy to use in analysis and design for a system.
